- [] Use VBOs or display lists
- [X] Transition smoothly between colors

### Medium:
- [X] Implement mouse based rotation and zooming. Rotation is slow, though.

### Hard:
- [] Implement mesh simplification method

## Unlisted extras:
- [X] Cycle between meshes
- [X] Axis specific rotation (X,Y,Z) in both directions
- [X] Soft-coded refresh rate
